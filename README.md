# Django Projects - Learning Journey

This repository is a collection of the Django projects I've built while learning the framework. Each project highlights key concepts and techniques I've practiced along the way.

## Projects

1. **Project 1 - Django Polls App**  
   This is the classic Django Polls app, built by following the official Django tutorial. It allows users to vote on poll questions and view results. This project helped me grasp key Django concepts like models, views, URLs, and templates.

2. **Project 2 - Blog Project**  
   A blog application developed by following Dave Gray's tutorial. This project covers CRUD operations, user authentication, and the use of Django's admin interface for managing blog posts.

3. **Project 5 - SaaS Foundations **  
   Currently working on the SaaS Foundations project, following the tutorial by Coding for Entrepreneurs. This project is focused on building a Software as a Service (SaaS) application, covering more advanced Django concepts such as subscription models, user management, and billing integration.
